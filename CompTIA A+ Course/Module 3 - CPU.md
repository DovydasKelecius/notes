# Technology and Characteristics
---
## CPU Overview
---
- **Central Processing Unit**
	- Most expensive and important component
	- Executes instructions, making it the brain of the computer
	- It MUST be compatible with the motherboard

---
## Clock rate

- Identifies the frequency (speed) of the CPU
- Measured in hertz (Hz), or cycles per  second
- Most CPU's today use Giga-Hertz  (Ghz)

---
## Clock speed

-  While Clock Rate measures the potential Speed, Clock speed indicates its actual speed just like a car.  

- External clock speed:
	-  The base clock of the motherboard, known as the bus speed.
	- Also the "external" clock speed
	- Generally the frequency of the FSB (Front side bus)

- Internal clock speed:
	- The internal speed of the CPU
	- The well-known numbers you see marketed on the CPU

- Overclocking:
	- Tell the motherboard to tell the CPU is actually faster than it is and it pushes it and overclocks it.

---
## Characteristics

- Cache size / type:
	- Cache is like a buffer zone that allow CPU to get information when it slows down
	- L1 is the fastest (Built on the CPU) also  the most smallest and expensive
	- L2 Accessed after L1 but faster than L3
	- L3 - Largest capacity but the slowest (Talks to RAM Chips)

---
## Hyperthreading

-  Allows a single CPU to accept and process two independent sets of instructions
-  Simulates  as  if 1-core CPU is 2-core

- Multicore:
	- The CPU physically contains two or more actual processing cores
	- With hyperthreading, it would double the "cores"

---
## Architecture  32-bit vs 64-bit

- Incorporating registers that are 64-bits wide, which allows the CPU to process higher data-types
- 32-bit architecture is limited  to 4GB (RAM)  of data address space
- Software must support 64-bit as well
- Also referred to as x86 or x64

---
## Virtualization

- Allows a single physical system to run multiple virtual systems.
- Centralizes hardware and improves resource usage.
- The Future of computing.

---
## Integrated GPU

- Graphics processing unit is specifically a process for graphics on the CPU chip itself

---
# Socket Types
---
# Socket Overview

-  **ZIF Socket - Zero Insertion Force**
	- Invented to avoid issues caused by applying too much force during installation
	- Uses a level to push sprung the chip into the place on the sockets softly, so it doesn't break anything.

- **PGA - Pin Grid Array**
	- Pints are  arranged in a square shape, in a regular array on the underside
	- Allows for more pins-per-circuit

- **LGA - Land Grid Array**
	- Pins are on the socket rather than on the circuit (CPU)
	- Square grid array on the underside of the circuit

# Cooling
---
## Why?

- Electricity causes heat (due to friction
- Heat damages (melts)  metal and electronics
- Smaller electronics means more heat in less space
- Need to dissipate this heat to prevent damage

- Heat sink- Passive
- Fans - Active
- Thermal Compounds  - between CPU and Heatsink
