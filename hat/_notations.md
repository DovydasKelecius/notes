### Network
#### `TCP - Transmission Control Protocol`
```
It's a Three Way Handshake:
SYN > SYN ACK > ACK


SYN, SYN ACK, ACK - packets
```
%% [[_notations#^746c59|Three Way Handshake]]
User sends a SYN packet - greeting
Receiver responds with SYN ACK - acknowledgement
User gets Receivers acknowledgement with ACK
%%

This is done to understand which protocol the receiver uses (ports).  Each specific port has different protocols (443 - HTTPS, 80  -  HTTP, etc).
